About This Weather Forecasting Project

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL.  This project will include building a weather dashboard using the OpenWeather API.

User Story: As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accoridingly.

Psuedo Strategy 

- Use the OpenWeatherAPI to retreive weather data for cities.
- Use AJAX to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format.
- App should be able to run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
- Display the following under current weather conditions:

  City
